# BMP280_Driver
 It contains driver files and application for STM32 users. It support I2C interface in communication

# Sensor Overview
The BMP280 is an absolute barometric pressure sensor especially designed for mobile applications.The emerging applications of indoor navigation, fitness as well as GPS refinement require a high relative accuracy and a low TCO at the same time. BMP180 and BMP280 are perfectly suitable for applications like floor detection since both sensors feature excellent relative accuracy is ±0.12 hPa, which is equivalent to ±1 m difference in altitude.

# Key features
• Pressure range 300 … 1100 hPa (equiv. to +9000…-500 m above/below sea level)

• Package 8-pin LGA metal-lid Footprint : 2.0 × 2.5 mm², height: 0.95 mm

• Relative accuracy ±0.12 hPa, equiv. to ±1 m (700 … 900hPa @25°C) 

• Absolute accuracy typ. ±1 hPa (950 ...1050 hPa, 0 ...+40 °C) 

• Temperature coefficient offset 1.5 Pa/K, equiv. to 12.6 cm/K (25 ... 40°C @900hPa) 

• Digital interfaces I²C (up to 3.4 MHz) SPI (3 and 4 wire, up to 10 MHz) 

• Current consumption 2.7µA @ 1 Hz sampling rate • Temperature range -40 … +85 °C
