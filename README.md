 It contains driver files and application for STM32 users. It support I2C interface in communication

# Sensor Overview
The BMP280 is an absolute barometric pressure sensor especially designed for mobile applications.The emerging applications of indoor navigation, fitness as well as GPS refinement require a high relative accuracy and a low TCO at the same time. BMP180 and BMP280 are perfectly suitable for applications like floor detection since both sensors feature excellent relative accuracy is ±0.12 hPa, which is equivalent to ±1 m difference in altitude.
